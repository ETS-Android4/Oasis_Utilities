## Purpose
This app was created specifically for Alkhanshali Inc. and its gas stations. The purpose of this app is to digitize the end day reports to have a digital copy
in case of need and to create a check database system between the three stores. By having this check database, workers in each store can see if the customer
has cashed a check before or if any of the customer's checks were fake and so on. This app also stores the customer information so the workers won't have to take 
any more of their information and as a result, saves time.
